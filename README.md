# unit-circle
Graphically demonstrates that the shape of the sine, cosine, and tangent functions are derived from geometric relationships on the unit circle.

Functions are not labeled at startup, encouraging users to discover geometric relationships themselves. Labels for
these "mystery functions" may be revealed by choosing Display > Indentify Functions in the menubar and entering
"elliot" (without quotes) as the password.
