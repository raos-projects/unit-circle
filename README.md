# unit-circle
Graphically demonstrates that the shape of the sine, cosine, and tangent functions are derived from geometric
relationships on the unit circle.

This program was conceived as part of a class project in the Mathematical Investigations - IV course taught by
Dr. Vince Matsko at the Illinois Math and Science Academy (IMSA) in Fall 2010 (the author's sophomore year of
high school). The final version shared here was prepared over the next year and completed by the middle of Fall
2011 for use in Dr. Matsko's subsequent courses.

Functions are not labeled at startup, encouraging users to discover geometric relationships themselves. Labels for
these "mystery functions" may be revealed by choosing "Display > Indentify Functions" in the menubar and entering
"elliot" (without quotes) as the password. Elliot was the given name of a meter stick in an IMSA classroom.
